I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

Security
I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

        <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
        <p>Terms & Conditions
Terms and Conditions

By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you. You should make sure, therefore, that you read them carefully before using the app. You are not allowed to copy, modify, or alter the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You are not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, nor should you try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Service.

We reserve the right to suspend accounts if we suspect suspicious activity. We take our Terms of Service very seriously, and violating it could result in revoked access, account deletion, or removal of your content. The use of a VPN (Virtual Private Network) service while using the app is not permitted.

Service is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you what you are paying for.

The app stores and processes personal data that you provide to us in order to deliver our Service. It is your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We strongly recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, as this process removes software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Doing so may make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features, and may prevent the app from working properly or at all.

Usage Responsibility
Certain functions of the app will require an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. Service cannot take responsibility if the app does not work fully due to a lack of access to Wi-Fi or insufficient mobile data.

If you use the app outside of Wi-Fi coverage, your mobile network provider’s terms of agreement will still apply. As a result, you may incur data charges or other third-party fees, including roaming charges, if you use the app outside of your home region or country without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the app, it is assumed you have permission from the bill payer to use the app.

Similarly, Service cannot accept responsibility for issues caused by the way you use the app. For example, it is your responsibility to ensure your device stays charged. If it runs out of battery and you cannot use the Service, Service will not be held accountable.

Service endeavors to keep the app updated and functional. However, updates may rely on third-party information. Service is not liable for any direct or indirect loss you may experience as a result of relying on the app's functionality or information.

Updates and Termination
At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android, and the requirements for using the app may change. You will need to download updates to continue using the app. Service does not guarantee that it will always support your device’s version of Android or continue providing updates.

We may also stop providing the app at any time without notice. Upon termination, the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end, and you must stop using the app and delete it from your device if necessary.

Disclaimers
As Is: The app and all materials and content available through the app are provided “as is” and on an “as available” basis, without any warranties or conditions, express or implied. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Service disclaims all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. Service does not guarantee uninterrupted functionality, freedom from errors, or security of the app.
No Responsibility: You assume all risks related to your use of the app. Service is not responsible for any damage to your device, loss of data, or harm resulting from using the app or downloading its content. These limitations apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
Changes to These Terms and Conditions
We may update these Terms and Conditions periodically. You are encouraged to review this page for updates. Changes will take effect immediately after they are posted on this page.
